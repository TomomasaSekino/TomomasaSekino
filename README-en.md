# 👋 Hi, I'm Sekino — AIX / UNIX Infrastructure Engineer

I have over **20 years of experience** designing, building, operating, and upgrading  
enterprise-grade infrastructure, primarily on **AIX / UNIX** platforms.

My expertise spans PowerVM (LPAR / dLPAR / LPM), HA configurations, storage virtualization,  
SAN architecture, backup systems, and enterprise monitoring.  
I have supported mission-critical environments across industries such as manufacturing,  
telecommunications, and finance.

Currently, I am expanding my skill set toward **cloud technologies (AWS), automation,  
and modern infrastructure practices**, aiming to bridge traditional enterprise systems  
with next-generation architectures.
